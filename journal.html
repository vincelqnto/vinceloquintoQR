<h3>Favorite things to do</h3>

<p>Playing guitar is probably my favorite thing to do,
  My day isn't complete without playing a guitar. It really makes my day so much better. <br>
<br>
Second is playing sports especially takraw and soccer, It is the reason too
why I had met a lot of good friends, and I had also been in different places because of it, it gave
me such good experience which I am grateful for, and will be remembered for the rest of this life.
